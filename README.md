Just a student project :)

Goal :
Making a simple and professional portfolio using bootstrap, it works in french and english (button in site)

I don't think that I'll update this one in the future so, the few bugs will not be patched...

Have a nice day,
Kaillxu


PS : You can download it if you want to mess around with it (to make another portfolio for exemple)
